# Progress: Bevy Playground

## What Works
- ✅ Basic project setup with Bevy 0.15.3
- ✅ Development environment configuration (DevContainer)
- ✅ Simple 2D game with movable shape:
  - ✅ Visual representation with `Sprite` component
  - ✅ Player entity with `Transform` component
  - ✅ Keyboard input handling with `ButtonInput<KeyCode>`
  - ✅ Movement system with normalized direction vectors
  - ✅ Time-based movement using `delta_secs()`
- ✅ Memory bank documentation initialized and updated

## What's Left to Build

### Short-term Goals
1. **Enhanced Visual Representation**
   - [ ] Add more visual elements (shapes, sprites)
   - [ ] Create a simple 2D scene with background
   - [ ] Add visual feedback for movement (e.g., rotation, animation)

2. **Expanded Interaction**
   - [ ] Add boundaries to prevent moving off-screen
   - [ ] Implement collision detection
   - [ ] Add objects to interact with (collectibles, obstacles)

3. **Code Organization**
   - [ ] Refactor into multiple modules
   - [ ] Create structure for multiple experiments
   - [ ] Improve documentation and comments

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Multiple Experiments**
   - [ ] Create a menu system for selecting demos
   - [ ] Implement state management for switching between demos
   - [ ] Add 2-3 distinct examples showcasing different Bevy features

2. **Advanced ECS Features**
   - [ ] Demonstrate parent-child relationships
   - [ ] Implement component change detection
   - [ ] Show system sets and run conditions

3. **Asset Management**
   - [ ] Add sprite assets
   - [ ] Implement asset loading systems
   - [ ] Create simple animations

### Long-term Goals
1. **Complete Demo Suite**
   - [ ] Comprehensive examples covering major Bevy features
   - [ ] Interactive tutorials with explanations
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimization examples

2. **Advanced Graphics**
   - [ ] 3D rendering examples
   - [ ] Shader implementations
   - [ ] Post-processing effects

3. **Game Mechanics**
   - [ ] Physics-based gameplay examples
   - [ ] AI behavior demonstrations
   - [ ] Complete mini-game implementations

## Current Status
The project now has a simple 2D game with a blue square that can be moved around the screen using arrow keys or WASD. The implementation demonstrates key Bevy concepts including ECS architecture, input handling, and 2D rendering.

The code is structured to use modern Bevy 0.15.3 APIs, avoiding deprecated features and following best practices. The movement system uses normalized vectors to ensure consistent speed in all directions.

## Known Issues
- Running the application in the DevContainer environment results in a windowing error due to lack of X11 display server access
- Limited to a single example
- No collision detection or boundaries
- No asset loading or management

## Project Evolution
- **Initial Concept**: Create a playground for learning and experimenting with Bevy
- **Current State**: Simple 2D game with movable shape
- **Next Evolution**: Add more game elements and interactions
- **Future Vision**: Comprehensive suite of examples and demos showcasing Bevy features
