# Progress: Bevy Playground

## What Works
- ✅ Basic project setup with Bevy 0.15.3
- ✅ Development environment configuration (DevContainer)
  - ✅ Simplified container without native UI dependencies
  - ✅ Browser-only UI support in the container
  - ✅ Headless browser support with all required dependencies
  - ✅ Automatic installation of browser dependencies on container creation
- ✅ Simple 2D game with movable shape:
  - ✅ Visual representation with `Sprite` component
  - ✅ Player entity with `Transform` component
  - ✅ Keyboard input handling with `ButtonInput<KeyCode>`
  - ✅ Movement system with normalized direction vectors
  - ✅ Time-based movement using `delta_secs()`
- ✅ Memory bank documentation initialized and updated
- ✅ WebAssembly (WASM) support:
  - ✅ Project restructured as library + binary
  - ✅ WASM-specific dependencies added
  - ✅ Web directory with HTML, CSS, and build scripts
  - ✅ Build script for compiling to WASM
  - ✅ Local development server for testing
  - ✅ Improved error handling for WASM-specific exceptions
  - ✅ Working browser-based game with keyboard controls
- ✅ Streamlined development workflow:
  - ✅ Manual build and test process for web development
  - ✅ Removed dev/watch mode for automatic rebuilding

## What's Left to Build

### Short-term Goals
1. **Enhanced Visual Representation**
   - [ ] Add more visual elements (shapes, sprites)
   - [ ] Create a simple 2D scene with background
   - [ ] Add visual feedback for movement (e.g., rotation, animation)

2. **Expanded Interaction**
   - [ ] Add boundaries to prevent moving off-screen
   - [ ] Implement collision detection
   - [ ] Add objects to interact with (collectibles, obstacles)

3. **Code Organization**
   - [x] Refactor into library + binary structure
   - [ ] Further refactor into multiple modules
   - [ ] Create structure for multiple experiments
   - [ ] Improve documentation and comments

4. **Web Experience Improvements**
   - [ ] Add mobile touch controls for web version
   - [x] Improve error handling for WASM initialization
   - [ ] Add loading screen for WASM initialization
   - [ ] Optimize WASM bundle size
   - [ ] Add progressive web app features

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Multiple Experiments**
   - [ ] Create a menu system for selecting demos
   - [ ] Implement state management for switching between demos
   - [ ] Add 2-3 distinct examples showcasing different Bevy features

2. **Advanced ECS Features**
   - [ ] Demonstrate parent-child relationships
   - [ ] Implement component change detection
   - [ ] Show system sets and run conditions

3. **Asset Management**
   - [ ] Add sprite assets
   - [ ] Implement asset loading systems
   - [ ] Create simple animations

### Long-term Goals
1. **Complete Demo Suite**
   - [ ] Comprehensive examples covering major Bevy features
   - [ ] Interactive tutorials with explanations
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimization examples

2. **Advanced Graphics**
   - [ ] 3D rendering examples
   - [ ] Shader implementations
   - [ ] Post-processing effects

3. **Game Mechanics**
   - [ ] Physics-based gameplay examples
   - [ ] AI behavior demonstrations
   - [ ] Complete mini-game implementations

## Current Status
The project now has a simple 2D game with a blue square that can be moved around the screen using arrow keys or WASD. The implementation demonstrates key Bevy concepts including ECS architecture, input handling, and 2D rendering.

The code is structured to use modern Bevy 0.15.3 APIs, avoiding deprecated features and following best practices. The movement system uses normalized vectors to ensure consistent speed in all directions.

The project has been restructured to support both native and web (WASM) builds. The game logic is now in a library crate that can be compiled to both native and WASM targets. A web directory contains the necessary HTML, CSS, and build scripts for the web version.

The web version is now fully functional and can be accessed by running the server script (`./web/serve.sh`) and opening a browser to `http://localhost:8000`. The HTML interface has been improved to handle WASM-specific exceptions that are part of normal operation but might appear as errors.

The development environment has been simplified to focus on browser-based testing in the container. The devcontainer no longer includes dependencies for native UI support, and the development workflow has been streamlined to use a manual build and test process without automatic watch/rebuild functionality.

Browser testing within the container is now fully supported with all necessary dependencies installed automatically when the container is created. This allows for seamless testing of the WASM version of the game directly in the container environment.

## Known Issues
- Running the native application in the DevContainer environment is not supported due to the removal of native UI dependencies
- Limited to a single example
- No collision detection or boundaries
- No asset loading or management
- Web version may have performance differences compared to native
- No mobile touch controls for web version
- WASM initialization may show a misleading error message about "Using exceptions for control flow" which is actually normal behavior
- Manual build and test process requires more steps than the previous watch mode

## Project Evolution
- **Initial Concept**: Create a playground for learning and experimenting with Bevy
- **Current State**: Simple 2D game with movable shape
- **Next Evolution**: Add more game elements and interactions
- **Future Vision**: Comprehensive suite of examples and demos showcasing Bevy features
