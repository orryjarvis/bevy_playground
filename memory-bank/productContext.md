# Product Context: Bevy Playground

## Purpose
Bevy Playground exists to provide a structured environment for learning and experimenting with the Bevy game engine. It addresses the need for a sandbox where game development concepts can be tested and refined without the constraints of a full game project.

## Problems Solved
1. **Learning Curve**: Game development with Bevy has a significant learning curve. This playground provides a low-stakes environment to experiment and learn.
2. **Concept Testing**: Allows for rapid testing of game mechanics and ideas before committing to implementing them in a larger project.
3. **Code Reference**: Creates a repository of working examples that can be referenced when building more complex games.
4. **Skill Development**: Facilitates the development of Rust and Bevy skills through practical application.

## Intended Functionality
The playground should:
- Support multiple independent experiments/demos
- Provide clear examples of Bevy's core systems (rendering, physics, input, etc.)
- Allow for easy navigation between different experiments
- Maintain a clean separation between different concepts being tested
- Include helpful comments and documentation for educational purposes

## User Experience Goals
As this is primarily a development tool, the "users" are developers who should experience:
1. **Clarity**: Code organization should be intuitive and well-documented
2. **Modularity**: Easy to add new experiments or modify existing ones
3. **Discoverability**: Simple to understand what each experiment demonstrates
4. **Educational Value**: Code should be written to be instructive, not just functional
5. **Rapid Iteration**: Quick feedback loop for testing changes

## Target Audience
- Rust developers learning game development
- Game developers learning Bevy
- Developers exploring ECS architecture
- Anyone interested in creating games or interactive applications with Rust
