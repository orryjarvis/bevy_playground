# Project Brief: Bevy Playground

## Overview
Bevy Playground is a project for experimenting with and learning the Bevy game engine in Rust. It serves as a sandbox environment for testing Bevy features, implementing game mechanics, and exploring game development concepts using Rust and the Bevy ECS (Entity Component System) framework.

## Core Requirements
1. Provide a flexible environment for Bevy engine experimentation
2. Support rapid prototyping of game mechanics and features
3. Maintain clean, well-documented code that demonstrates Bevy best practices
4. Allow for easy extension and modification as learning progresses

## Goals
- Learn Bevy ECS architecture and game development patterns
- Implement various game mechanics and visualizations
- Create reusable components and systems
- Explore Bevy's rendering, physics, and input handling capabilities
- Develop a foundation that can evolve into more complex game projects

## Scope
This project is primarily educational and experimental in nature. It is not intended to be a complete game but rather a collection of examples, experiments, and prototypes using the Bevy engine.

## Success Criteria
- Clean, well-organized code that follows Rust and Bevy best practices
- Functional demonstrations of various Bevy features
- Modular design that allows for easy addition of new experiments
- Comprehensive documentation of implemented features and learnings
