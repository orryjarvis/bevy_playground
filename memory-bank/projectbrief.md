# Project Brief: WebAssembly Multiplayer Game

## Core Vision
This project aims to develop a single, sophisticated multiplayer game targeting WebAssembly deployment. While the repository name "bevy_playground" might suggest a collection of demos, this is actually a misnomer - the project represents a serious endeavor to build a complete, production-ready game.

## Primary Objectives

### Technical Excellence
- Deep exploration and implementation of game architecture patterns
- Investigation of engine design principles in a modern context
- Development of robust networking models for multiplayer gameplay
- Leveraging Rust and WebAssembly for performance and safety

### Development Focus
1. Foundation First
   - Establishing solid asset pipelines
   - Building networking infrastructure
   - Designing scalable ECS architecture
   - Creating deployment workflows

2. Production Quality
   - Targeting deployment via SaaS platform
   - Building for real-world performance
   - Implementing proper error handling
   - Ensuring cross-browser compatibility

## Project Scope
This is a ground-up development effort starting from scratch. The initial phases will focus heavily on infrastructure and foundational systems before moving into gameplay mechanics.

### Key Areas of Focus
1. Asset Pipeline Development
   - Efficient asset loading and management
   - Resource optimization for web deployment
   - Asset versioning and updates

2. Networking Architecture
   - State synchronization
   - Client-server communication
   - Latency compensation

3. ECS Structure
   - Component design
   - System organization
   - Entity management

4. Engine Integration
   - Bevy engine optimization
   - WebAssembly performance tuning
   - Browser compatibility
   - Memory management

## Success Criteria
- Robust and scalable foundational architecture
- Efficient networking implementation
- Smooth WebAssembly performance
- Production-ready deployment pipeline
- Clean, maintainable codebase
